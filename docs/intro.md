# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the **DevDumper** project. This documentation is intended to help you understand the
project and how to use it.

## What is DevDumper?

DevDumper is a desktop application that allows you to dump your variables or objects to the app. You can debug your code
by dumping your variables or objects to the app and see the output in a more readable way.

Here is an example of how you can use DevDumper in your PHP code:

```php
ddump('Hello world!');

ddump(['name' => 'John Doe', 'age' => 25]);

ddump(new MyClass());

ddump('First', 'Second', 'Third');
```

- **Dumping**: Dumping is the process of printing the value of a variable or object to the app.
- **Categorized**: The dumped variables or objects are categorized by their type.
- **Readable**: The dumped variables or objects are displayed in a more readable way.
- **Integrated**: The app is integrated with the framework or library you are using.
